# Eqdisplay-2
This is the second version, a python GUI project that helps creating mathematical equations in text files by placing complex symbols on the screen just by typing their names. This project is mainly used for creating formula sheets.

Once the app is opened, the first thing on screen is a dialogbox where you have to save your file. If you wish to open an existing file, just cancel the dialogbox and open a file from the nav bar on top.

Next thing is to start typing text on to the main (big) box. In case you want to insert a symbol, go and type the name of the desired symbol in the smaller box.

You can add and view existing symbols and their names from the nav bar on top.

Thank you!
